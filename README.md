# StudentManagementSystem
The Student Management System software developed using WPF and C# is a powerful and user-friendly application designed to efficiently manage student information. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, it simplifies the task of organizing and maintaining student data for educational institutions.

The software offers a range of essential fields to capture relevant student details. Each student is assigned a unique ID, allowing for easy identification and reference. The system records their first name, last name, profile picture, date of birth, department, and GPA value. This ensures that all crucial information is readily available for effective student management.

To streamline the data entry process, the system provides a selection of four departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Information Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Civil Engineering. This predefined list enhances data consistency and simplifies departmental categorization.

The software incorporates user-friendly notification messages to enhance the user experience. For instance, when attempting to update or create a new student with empty fields, warning messages promptly alert the user, ensuring all required fields are completed before proceeding. This feature helps maintain data integrity and accuracy.
